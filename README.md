# How to change fonts in CS:GO after the Panorama Update
https://www.dropbox.com/sh/5aokqe2bkzl9yy3/AADEGk1wakXJ4KL6F0kwuaoba?dl=0

1. If you wan't a custom font just download one from https://www.dafont.com and install it. (you do not need to place your custom font file in the fonts folder) 

2. After that replace RuneScape UF in all the text files with the font name (NOT the file name, but the font name. You can find the font name when you open the font file on the top left)

3. On row 40 in the fonts.conf file place the file name of the font NOT the font name like it said in step 2 

4. On row 89 replace pixelsize with 1.0 instead of 1.2, if you dont your font will look weird and small/blurry

This is Comanglia Stability config + Blocky Textures + I removed network settings.
The reason i removed network settings is be cause if people have bad PCs they usually have bad network so i didnt wanna mess with anything.
I hope you understand my point.
